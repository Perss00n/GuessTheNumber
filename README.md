# Guess The Number Game

A simple console game made by me in C# where the user tries to guess a number randomly generated by the computer.

## How to Play

- The computer selects a random number between 1 and 10.
- The player has 3 attempts to guess the correct number.
- After each guess, the program will tell the user whether the guess was correct or not.
- If the user guesses correctly, they win. If they use all 3 guesses without guessing the number, they lose.

## Features

- **Input validation**: The game ensures that the player enters a valid integer between 1 and 10.
- **Limited attempts**: Players can only guess up to 3 times.
- **Random number generation**: Each game generates a new random number to keep it fresh.

## Running the Game

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
3. Run the `GuessTheNumber` project.

Enjoy the game!
